# Inventory Project: Backend and Frontend

## Description
This is a simple project designed to help understand the integration between backend and frontend in web development. The system manages a basic inventory, demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products.

## Key Features
- Backend developed using [technology used, e.g., Spring Boot]
- Frontend developed in Angular
- Database created automatically from the backend
- Simple user interface using Bootstrap

## Novelty
The distinctive feature of this project is the automatic creation of the database from the backend, eliminating the need for manual SQL scripts. This simplifies the initial setup; however, for more complex projects, it is recommended to use SQL for greater control over the database structure.

## Frontend
The frontend is intentionally simple, utilizing Bootstrap for a quick and responsive design. If you are looking to create a more dynamic and customized web interface, consider not using Bootstrap and opting for a design from scratch.

## Usage and Improvements
This code is published as an educational resource and a starting point for similar projects. Users are free to use, modify, and improve the code according to their needs.

  Some potential areas for improvement include:
  - Implementing authentication and authorization
  - Adding more robust validations
  - Enhancing the user interface design
  - Implementing unit and integration tests
